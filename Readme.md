# WSDLtoObjC
Several years ago, I developed my first iOS app (MyFlightbook), which consumed a SOAP service.  I found WSDLToObjC at its [old home](https://github.com/ericberman/WSDLtoObjC.git).  It was open source (MIT License) but largely abandoned.

I made a few contributions before Google archived their code hosting, at which point I was pretty clearly the only client for it and thus brought the code into my own source tree.  I have made small changes since then, mostly to keep up with Apple's ever growing list of deprecations and other similar changes.

But as I move the MyFlightbook code into the open source world, I am re-introducing WSDLToObjC to the open source community again, under its original MIT license.

Thanks
